- **High**: Serious vulnerabilities that should be prioritized
- **Medium**: Moderate risk vulnerabilities that should be addressed
- **Low**: Minor issues that represent minimal risk
- **Informational**: Findings that don't represent a direct risk but could be useful for security hardening

Each vulnerability report includes:

- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- The affected URL and parameters
- Evidence of the vulnerability
- Technical details about how it was discovered
- Recommended remediation steps
- References to relevant security resources

## üîÑ Advanced Configuration

WhiteCrow can be customized through the settings panel:

- **Scan Depth**: Control how thoroughly the scanner crawls the target application
